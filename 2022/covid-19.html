                <h3>News</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Date 25/4/22:</strong>
                  <strong>Since 20/4/22, it is no longer mandatory to wear masks in enclosed spaces in Spain.</strong>
                  In-person congresses, conventions, trade fairs and similar activities in enclosed spaces require that
                  the minimum ventilation levels set out in the current regulations on thermal installations of
                  buildings be guaranteed.

                  When there are more than 1,000 people in attendance at such events:

                <ul>
                  <li>Compliance with enhanced ventilation and air quality conditions is recommended.</li>
                  <li>Crowd control measures must be put in place, both indoors and outdoors.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>

                For all our events, including conferences, workshops, and social events, we take the COVID-situation
                seriously. We want to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible, and keep everyone safe.

                Here you can check the local measures that apply to us on the basis of our <a
                href="https://web.gencat.cat/en/activem/restriccions-territorials/catalunya/#bloc7">government in
                Catalonia</a>, we will adhere to their regulations and guidelines, and when deemed necessary, take
                additional measures at our discretion. As regulations and best practices around COVID management for
                events evolve constantly, we may change our approach up to the last moment.

                The latest version of this policy is available at <a href="https://www.jbcnconf.com/2022/covid-19.html">COVID-19
                Policy</a>.

                If you have any questions or concerns about our COVID-19 policy, please do not hesitate to contact us
                via <a href="mailto:info@barcelonajug.org">info@barcelonajug.org</a>.

                <h3>What we expect from you</h3>
                This policy applies to all participants, including visitors, speakers, organisers, vendors, sponsors,
                and staff.

                During the event, as well during your interactions with other participants outside the event, we expect
                you to adhere to both <a
                href="https://web.gencat.cat/en/activem/restriccions-territorials/catalunya/#bloc7">local
                governmental</a> measures and our additional measures.

                Our measures may include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Providing proof of vaccination, or a recent (<24h) negative test, upon entry of the venue</li>
                  <li>Mandatory use of face-masks</li>
                  <li>Testing attendees upon entry</li>
                  <li>Limiting capacity to certain sessions</li>
                  <li>This list is non-exhaustive.</li>
                </ul>

                If a participant doesn't comply to the policy, the event organisers may take any action they deem
                appropriate, including warning the offender or removing them from the event with no right to a refund.

                <h3>What you can expect from us</h3>
                Together with the venue and our suppliers, we will take appropriate measures to create safe conditions
                for everyone, based on regulations, best practices, and guidelines.

                Our measures may include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Creating fresh air flows</li>
                  <li>Providing masks and disinfectant dispensers</li>
                  <li>Adapting catering for safety</li>
                  <li>Limiting capacity for certain activities</li>
                  <li>Air quality control monitoring</li>
                  <li>This list is non-exhaustive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What if we cancel or postpone an event?</h3>
                If the conditions or local regulations make it impossible to organise the event responsibly, the event
                will be postponed.

                After a new date has been announced, the participants will be given the choice to transfer their ticket
                to the new dates, or to receive a full refund of the ticket cost.

                Changes in the program or schedule of an event are not grounds for a full refund, except as stipulated
                in the <a href="https://www.jbcnconf.com/2022/conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>.

                <h3>Expenses</h3>
                We will not reimburse any expenses that you may have made, such as travel, accommodation, or any other
                kind. We advise you to choose refundable travel and accommodation options.
